I was raised in rural areas which had no decent department stores; also, my parents had no time to think about what their kids’ need because they were always busy with farm work. For several years, I had been so anxious to celebrate Christmas because I had felt so lonely and people on TV look so happy while decorating a tree and untying ribbons on packages. When I was nine, I decided to make a Christmas tree by myself. First, I went up a back hill with my brother and brought a small pine tree. Meanwhile, my sister searched for any glitter for the tree decoration through the house. However, there wasn’t any fancy trimming, but only some white cotton from the first-aid kit. I decided to get some decorations from another Christmas tree at a church near my house. There was a colossal tree decorated with flashy ornaments in the front yard of church. In the darkness of night, while my sister had been standing guard, I sneaked up stairs like a cat and reached under the tree. The tree was beautiful with many colored lights and those were twinkling oddly. I looked at the tree in delight for a long time and felt warm and so magnificent. I couldn’t get even a small red ribbon on the tree. Instead, I found a few pieces of glitter on the ground. Like this, my first Christmas tree was not showy at all, but it is indelible memory in my mind.</p>
