        <h1>Prog 270 Song</h1>

        <p>I’m Chang-Ryeol (Tim) Song. My Korean name is quite hard to pronounce, so please call me Tim.

I have been working as a software engineer for about 10 years for a mobile company. I worked for modem protocol, middle-ware development, and GPS/Location fields. I learned C++ and Java 15 years ago when I was in college, but the main development language was C at the company.

I took one year break from my company and came to Bellevue College to improve my English proficiency. However, I decided to take some programming classes since I wanted to get some experience in my fields here.

I’m excited to learn various and categorized programming information from my teacher. Specially, I would like to experience of mobile app. development and web programming which is untried for me.

I have some phones and a Wi-Fi tablet which are operated with Android.

I like tennis and hiking. Tennis is my favorite sport these days. :)</p>
