I’m dreaming of a cozy and convenient place to live happily with my family and friends. Walking along the long vineyard, you can see two big trees in front of my exotic dream house. One is a fir tree which is decorated with a lot of twinkling lights, and the other is a maple tree which has red leaves falling on the grass to the rhythm of breeze. Beside the trees, here is neatly trimmed grass for golf putting and an outdoor table for barbeque. Smelling the new mown grass let’s get into the house. My living room with a high ceiling has a big and elegant crystal chandelier which is illuminating the hall softly and glittering itself. On the left side of the living room, there’s a shiny marble table covered with thick glass. A big circle window toward the yard is reflecting a live classic concert from a laser project. A fireplace is warming the hall, and above the fireplace the Mona Lisa is smiling. Passing by the living room, you would hear a sound of something burning – cheeeeez – is getting closer. Full of delicious smell of steak would make you sniff and finally assure you that there’s a futuristic kitchen with a small bar where a chef is preparing food and wine. On the other side of the living room, there are special rooms for entertainment, massage, and observing the stars. Behind the living room, there is a fascinating indoor tennis court where my family has fun. I would be happy with my family in my dream house. For this dream, I am still working hard.
