# Computing General Environment
There are some very important things that we need to know who want to be a good computer science guy.

## Google Things
I think almost everyone who is in the computing industry used Google things more than once in their life. Let's deep into them a little bit.

### Google drive
We can utilize free 15GB(or 17G) cloud drive for personal usage.
It's good things.
#### Sharing function
It's very convenient to share something to any other person.
Let's use it.

## Twitter
Twitter is one of good sources for **tech** information.  
In my case, it was best resource center for all kinds of information.

## Evernote
It is very useful note in cloud.
We can access anytime to our note whenever we are online.
I used this note to summarize all things from in-class.

## Microsoft Onenote
It is also very organized tool for save anything in the cloud.
I sometimes use this tool in my job before.
