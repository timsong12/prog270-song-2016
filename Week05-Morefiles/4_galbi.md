Galbi or kalbi generally refers to a variety of gui or grilled dishes in Korean cuisine that are made with marinated beef (or pork) short ribs in a ganjang-based sauce (Korean soy sauce).[1] In the Korean language, galbi literally means "rib" and can refer to cooked or uncooked ribs. Although the dish's full name is galbi gui, the word "gui" (grilling) is commonly omitted. Suwon and Los Angeles are particularly known for their galbi.

Galbi is generally made with beef ribs, and it may be called "sogalbi" (소갈비) or "soegalbi" (쇠갈비). The prefix "so" or "soe" (beef) is often omitted when referring to beef ribs. It is also called bulgalbi when grilled over fire. Galbi can also be made with pork ribs or chicken; in such cases, the dish is called "dwaeji galbi" (돼지갈비) or "dak galbi" (닭갈비) to emphasize the main ingredient.

It is listed at number 41 on the World's 50 most delicious foods readers' poll complied by CNN Go in 2011.
