Bulgogi (Korean pronunciation: [pulɡoɡi]; Korean: 불고기) is a Korean dish that usually consists of grilled marinated beef.

The word Bulgogi literally means fire meat in Korean, and is derived from the Pyong'an dialect. It refers to marinated meat, (generally beef if used without a qualifier), cooked using traditional grilling techniques such as gridirons or perforated dome griddles that sit on braziers, unlike deep frying or boiling in water. The term is also applied to variations such a dak bulgogi (made with chicken) or dwaeji bulgogi (made with pork), depending on what kind of meat and corresponding seasoning are used.
